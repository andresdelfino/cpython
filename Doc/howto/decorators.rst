This HOWTO explains how to write decorators and decorator factories.

Background
----------

Before discussing decorators and decorator factories, let's go over the things that make them possible in Python.

The most important thing is that functions, coroutines and classes are first-class citizens in Python, which allows us to:

* Pass them as arguments::

     help(print)

* Return them as values::

     def f():
         return print

     f()('Hello World')

* Bind them to new names::

     my_print = print
     my_print('Hello World')

Also, it's possible to define a function, a coroutine or a class in another definition::

   def nesting_func():
       def nested_func():
           print('Hello World')

       nested_func()
       print('This is getting old...')

   nesting_func()

Variables used by a nested function but not defined in it ("free variables") are looked up in the nesting function, recursively, until reaching the non-nested function, which looks for the variable at the module level::

   y = 'y'

   def nesting_func():
       x = 'x'

       def nested_func():
           print(x, y)

       nested_func()

   nesting_func()

The values that free variables had at the nested function definition time are saved in "closures"::

   import inspect

   y = 'y'

   def nesting_func():
       x = 'x'

       def nested_func():
           print(x, y, z)

       return nested_func

   my_func = nesting_func()
   y = '2'

   print(inspect.getclosurevars(my_func))

Closures allow nested functions to know the values of variables defined in functions whose lifetime has ended.

.. This is confusing.

   The lifetime of the outer function hasn't ended; only the execution
   of that function which created the inner function.  This is a fairly
   important distinction, especially when we're specifically interested
   in using the closure from our newly-created decorator.

Now that we have all the necessary building blocks, let's move forward.

Decorators
----------

To put it simply, decorators let you alter a call to a function, coroutine or class.

.. Not sure "coroutine" is helpful here; most likely a distraction,
   especially since there's no example using coroutines.

A decorator can be implemented with a function or a class.  When implemented with a function, the function must require only one argument; when implemented with a class, the class :meth:`__init__` method must require only one argument.  Said argument will reference the object to be decorated.

While it's usually the case for decorators to call the original object, it's not a requirement at all, and decorators can be written to outright ignore the original object.

.. A little confusing here.

   The uses for decorating a class are often substantially different
   from those of decorating a function.


Decorator functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decorator functions usually return a new function which at some point calls the original object::

   def decorator(obj):
       def decorated_object(*args, **kwargs):
           return obj(*args, **kwargs)

       return decorated_object

   print = decorator(print)

.. Decorating a built-in from within a module, even as an example, seems
   a really bad idea.  But I really like that you've started with a
   decorator usage that doesn't use decorator syntax.

Decorator classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decorator classes return an instance which at some point calls the original object::

   class Decorator:
       def __init__(self, obj):
           self.obj = obj

       def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           return self.obj(*args, **kwargs)

   print = Decorator(print)

Usually, decorator classes return descriptor instances.

.. A reference (probably using the seealso directive) to the descriptor
   howto would be useful here.


Preserving the original object metadata
---------------------------------------

All metadata of the original object is lost when a decorator returns a new object::

   def decorator(obj):
       def decorated_object(*args, **kwargs):
           return obj(*args, **kwargs)

       return decorated_object

   def function(a: int = 1, b: int) -> int:
       '''Returns a + b'''
       return a + b

   function = decorator(function)

   print(function.__qualname__)
   print(function.__doc__)
   print(function.__annotations__)

If the decorator acts as a wrapper instead of replacing the original object behaviour, this might be an inconvenience.

Decorator functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To remediate this, the standard library provides the :meth:`functools.update_wrapper` function which copies the relevant metadata from the original object to the decorated object::

   import functools

   def decorator(obj):
       def decorated_object(*args, **kwargs):
           return obj(*args, **kwargs)

       functools.update_wrapper(decorated_object, obj)

       return decorated_object

   def function(a: int, b: int) -> int:
       '''Returns a + b'''
       return a + b

   function = decorator(function)

   print(function.__qualname__)
   print(function.__doc__)
   print(function.__annotations__)

.. Using `functools.wraps` is often more readable; perhaps that's worth
   an example.  It's documentation goes into more detail about how it
   relates to `update_wrapper`.  While sematically equivalent, it
   provides the reader context at the definition of the inner function
   that this is what's being returned.  (Useful when there's more than
   one inner function!)


Decorator classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preserving a reference to the original object
---------------------------------------------

It's usually helpful to reference the original value of a decorated object.

:meth:`functools.update_wrapper`, addresses this by setting the ``__wrapped__`` attribute in the decorated object. This attribute is read by several functions in the :mod:`inspect` module.

If you do not use :meth:`functools.update_wrapper` when implementing a decorator function, or when implementing decorator classes, you may want to manually set ``__wrapped__`` to the original object::

   def decorator(obj):
       def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
           return obj(*args, **kwargs)
   
       decorated.__wrapped__ = obj
       return decorated

.. It's worth really pushing use of ``functools.wraps`` and/or
   ``functools.update_wrapper`` here.  Doing that will provide better
   forward compatibility if additional attributes are added that should
   be propagated to the wrapper.

   The ``__wrapped__`` attribute is really for introspection support,
   and is not needed to keep the wrapped object alive, since it's
   referenced from the closure (which is cleaner and less prone to
   external influence, like the wrapper getting wrapped again).

Decorator factories
-------------------

Requiring only one parameter with fixed semantics, decorators have no parametrization.

Enter decorator factories.  Decorator factories take as many arguments as needed, create a decorator, and return it.

As with decorators, decorator factories can be implemented with functions or classes.

Decorator factory functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decorator factory functions create a decorator, and make use of closures to provide the decorator its arguments.

Example::

   import datetime

   def decorator_factory(format='%Y-%m-%d %M:%H:%S'):
       def decorator(obj):
           def decorated_object(*args, **kwargs):
               timestamp = datetime.datetime.today()
               print('{:{}} Start'.format(timestamp, format))

               return obj(*args, **kwargs)

           return decorated_object

       return decorator

   def obj():
       print('Test')

   obj = decorator_factory(format='%Y%m%dT%M%H%S')(obj)
   obj()

Decorator factory classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In decorator factory classes the :meth:`__init__` method acts as the decorator factory, storing all arguments as class attributes, and the :meth:`__call__` method acts as the decorator.

Example::

   import datetime

   class DecoratorFactory:
       def __init__(self, format='%Y-%m-%d %M:%H:%S'):
           self.format = format

       def __call__(obj, *args, **kwargs):
           def decorated_object(*args, **kwargs):
              timestamp = datetime.datetime.today()
              print('{:{}} Start'.format(timestamp, self.format))
 
               return obj(*args, **kwargs)
 
           return decorated_object

   def obj():
   	   print('Test')
   
   obj = DecoratorFactory(format='%Y%m%dT%M%H%S')(obj)
   obj()

Decoration at definition time
-----------------------------

To improve readability, Python provides syntactic sugar (known as pie syntax) for applying decorators at definition::

   @decoration
   decorated object definition

.. I think this is usually called decorator syntax.  We may have called
   it pie syntax when we were still playing with alternatives.

Where ``decoration`` is the name of a decorator or a call to a decorator factory.

For example, given the NOP decorator::

   def decorator(obj):
       return obj

It can be applied at definition time as::

   @decorator
   def obj():
       pass

Multiple decorators can be applied at definition time by putting each one in a new line::

   @time
   @log
   def obj():
       pass

When multiple decorators are specified, they are applied bottom to top.

Decoration at definition time is not always possible (as when the objects to be decorated are defined in a third party module), but when it is, it is much easier to read.

Examples in the standard library
--------------------------------

The standard library provides several decorators and decorator factories that can be studied to see how they work in production code:

=================================   ==========================================
:meth:`contextlib.contextmanager`   function decorator
:meth:`functools.total_ordering`    class decorator
:meth:`unittest.skip`               function decorator factory
:meth:`dataclasses.dataclass`       class decorator factory or class decorator
=================================   ==========================================
